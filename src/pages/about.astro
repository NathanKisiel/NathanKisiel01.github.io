      <p>
        I am a senior mathematics student pursuing a career in actuarial science. My interest in actuarial work developed
        through my passion for mathematics combined with an appreciation for financial systems and long-term planning.
        I am particularly interested in how mathematical theory can be used to model uncertainty, evaluate risk, and guide
        sound financial decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have focused on developing a strong foundation in probability, interest
        theory, and financial mathematics. My senior project explores loan repayment modeling using both discrete and
        continuous accumulation methods while accounting for inflation and real interest rates. This project allows me to
        bridge theoretical mathematics with real-world financial applications — an approach that reflects the core of
        actuarial work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond academics, I value continuous improvement and intellectual growth. I am always looking for opportunities to
        expand my understanding of financial systems, data analysis, and long-term risk modeling. My goal is to begin my actuarial career in a role where I can contribute to quantitative analysis, pricing,
        forecasting, and strategic decision-making while continuing to grow professionally toward full credentialing.
